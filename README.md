# Langley_Park_Dashboard_Project

This was a capstone project in INST 490 class. 
Our group worked with Langley Park Civic Association to create a dashboard where we collected data on students, teachers, and
school board membersâ€™ ethnicity to identify disparities in leadership and staff representation
across different ethnic groups.

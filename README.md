# Langley_Park_Dashboard_Project

This was a capstone project in INST 490 class. The data visualization part was done on Tableau. 
Our group worked with Langley Park Civic Association to create a dashboard where we collected data on students, teachers, and
school board members’ ethnicity to identify disparities in leadership and staff representation
across different ethnic groups.
